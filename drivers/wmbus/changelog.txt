   until it has found it.

New features:
-------------
- N/A

Bug Fixes:
----------
- Extension libraries (taht provides manufacturer specific decoding routines)
  are now loaded from folder $ROOTACT/lib/wmbus/preprocessor/ (was previously
	$ROOTACT/etc/wmbus/preprocessor/).
- Fixed. The manufacturer specific extensions (nxp.so for now) were not
  install by the APU.
- Fixed. There were alignment issues in decoding routines when running under
  ARM target.
- Fixed. Generated documents didn't comply to ETSI/M2M TS 102.966 
  specifications.
- Added the ability to change the trace level on-the-fly throught the 'trace'
  command at the telnet CLI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2013-05-29

New features:
-------------
- N/A

Bug Fixes:
----------
- Fixed. An error log entry was created each time a device reports data
  regarding the M2M interface "0x0020.0x0000.0.m2m". Indeed this interface is
  not supported by the driver; so this is not a relevant log. But the 
  consequence was that the log file is full of unrelevant logs.
- Fixed. The compilation of the manufacturer specific extensions (nxp.so for
  now) was not automated.

-------------
- rtbase: 1.0.33
- libxo: 4.2.8
- libdIa: 1.0.15

- m2mxoref: 1.1.12

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2013-05-28

New features:
-------------
- Added support for APU.
- Added extension manager to prevent the driver to load and unload the
  extension library for each reported measurement.

Bug Fixes:
----------
- Fixed. "tracesize" parameter from spvconfig.xml file was not taken into 
  account.
- Fixed. Missing "interfaceID" parameter in the M2M resources for device 
  application description.
- Fixed. Due to drvcommon upgrade, dIa messages for resources creation
  regarding device application data containers where not completed
  successfully. Resources creation is now spread over time (in function 
  "WmbusSensorClockSc"), and not more in dIa call back function as before.
- Fixed. Access rights in diatemplates were wrong, and access rights for
  device end point applications were not created.
- Re-write wmbus init script for using Actility "functions" script.
- Added "astyle" code formatter invoke automation.
- Fixed. An IPU application and a network application (so called 
  "NW_DungleID") was created when the driver does not manage to access the 
  WMBus dongle.
- Changed "bdd.xml" content file format: standardize attribute values format
  for hexadecimal, now all prefixed by "0x" ("min" and "max" of tag "<device>"
  and attribute "id" of tag "<profile>").
