Modbus GIP driver changelog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2014-09-25

New features:
-------------
 - Add support for <subattributes> in product description files (see
   wago-750-881-acy-custom.xml as example).
 
Bug Fixes:
----------
 - When loosing connection with the device, the driver did not try to
   reconnect. Fixed.
 - Version string (./modbus.x --version) was not using the same format as all
   other GIP drivers. Fixed.
 - The driver used to start a separated thread to access the ModBus devices 
   (read and write). But access the program data were not safely protected.
   Fixed: now the program does not start any other thread, and only run in a
   single-thread process.
