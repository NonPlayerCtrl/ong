Known issue
-----------

- When a device application is updated, old containers are not deleted
  Containers id are generated from 1 to n when iterate on the product descriptor,
  so it's very hard to detect which containers may not be delete. We can not use the
  mobus access descriptor to identify because multiple M2M Point can referer to the same
  modbus register.
  We maybe need to introduce UUID in the list of interfaces describe in the products XML,
  to match containers during update.

  Actually delete of containers is disable to avoid lost of data.

- Network on serial line are not restored yet.
